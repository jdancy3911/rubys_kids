						<h1>Ruby Darlene Brewington&nbsp;</h1>
						<h2>"The Jewel of our Community"</h2>
				      <p>&nbsp;Ruby Darlene Brewington had a beautfiul heart and enjoyed seeing smiles on the faces of everyone she encountered. Born and raised in North Carolina, she came from a large family of 10. As First Lady of her church in Mt. Gilead, NC, she founded social groups for kids in the community so that they would have a safe plce to convene and participate in fun activities, even providing them with school supplies and food when needed. Ruby was a talented seamstress. She would make dresses for her children's weddings and proms and for those in the community who could not afford expensive dresses.</p>
				      <p>&nbsp;</p>
                      <p>&nbsp;Ruby was also a skilled gardener and planted flowers and vegetables that she would often harvest and share with loved ones. Undoubtedly, she was a giver and someone who genuinely only wanted the best for and saw the best in people.</p>
                      <p>&nbsp;</p>
                      <p>&nbsp;Every year at Christmas, she chose a child's name off the "Angel Tree" where she worked. The names belonged to children in need of receiving gifts and food over the holidays, and she always made sure to help at least one child every year. Ruby loved and embodied the giving spirit. After her passing, her children started Ruby's Kids to honor her legacy and continue her tradition of giving.</p>
